## Coding Standards

### XML Documentation Requirements
**CRITICAL - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Every public and private method, property, constructor, enum, and class MUST have complete XML documentation. NO EXCEPTIONS.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Brief description of what the method does.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="paramName">Description of the parameter.</param>
/// <returns>Description of the return value.</returns>
/// <exception cref="ExceptionType">When this exception is thrown.</exception>
public ReturnType MethodName(ParameterType paramName)
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `SessionManager`, `CommandQueueService`) - MANDATORY
- **Methods**: PascalCase (e.g., `CreateSessionAsync`, `QueueCommand`) - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
- **Properties**: PascalCase (e.g., `SessionId`, `IsHealthy`) - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **Fields (including static fields)**: camelCase with `m_` prefix followed by PascalCase (e.g., `m_Logger`, `m_Sessions`, `m_CommandQueue`) - MANDATORY.
  - Static fields are treated as member variables for naming purposes and MUST also use the `m_` prefix (NOT `s_`) - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT.
  - Example: use `m_PathPattern` instead of `s_PathPattern` - NO EXCEPTIONS.
- **Constants**: PascalCase (e.g., `MaxSessions`, `DefaultTimeout`) - MANDATORY

**IMPORTANT - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Member variables must follow the pattern `m_PascalCase` where the first letter after the underscore is uppercase. This ensures consistency with C# naming conventions and improves code readability. NO EXCEPTIONS.
- **Enums**: PascalCase (e.g., `CommandState`, `CircuitState`) - MANDATORY

### Time Policy
- Use local time consistently across the codebase - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT.
- Prefer `DateTime.Now` over `DateTime.UtcNow` and `DateTimeOffset.Now` over `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` in any possible case - NO EXCEPTIONS.
- Logs, timestamps, metrics, and persisted times should all use local time to avoid confusion - MANDATORY.

### Code Organization
- **One class per file**: Each class in its own file - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
- **Namespace structure**: `mcp_nexus.{Category}` (e.g., `mcp_nexus.Session`, `mcp_nexus.CommandQueue`) - MANDATORY
- **Using statements**: Grouped by system, third-party, then project namespaces - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **Member variable placement**: **ALL member variables (fields, properties, constants) MUST be declared at the TOP of the class definition, before any methods or constructors** - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
- **Method ordering**: Constructors, public methods, private methods, dispose pattern - MANDATORY

## Domain Knowledge

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
- **Tools**: Expose debugging operations as MCP tools
- **Resources**: Provide data access through MCP resources
- **Standardized responses**: Always include `usage` field as last entry
- **Session isolation**: Each debugging session is completely isolated

### Windows Debugging
- **CDB Process Management**: Each session gets its own CDB process
- **Command Execution**: Asynchronous command queuing with timeout handling
- **Symbol Paths**: Support for symbol file directories
- **Dump Analysis**: Focus on crash dump (.dmp) file analysis

### Session Lifecycle
1. **Create**: `nexus_open_dump_analyze_session` - Creates isolated session
2. **Execute**: `nexus_enqueue_async_dump_analyze_command` - Queues commands
3. **Monitor**: `nexus_get_dump_analyze_commands_status` - Bulk status polling (recommended)
4. **Retrieve**: `nexus_read_dump_analyze_command_result` - Get individual results
5. **Close**: `nexus_close_dump_analyze_session` - Clean up resources

**Efficient Monitoring Pattern:**
- Use `nexus_get_dump_analyze_commands_status` to poll ALL commands in a session at once
- Much more efficient than individual command polling
- Returns status, timing, and progress for all commands
- Use `nexus_read_dump_analyze_command_result` only when status shows "Completed"

### Command Queue System
- **Sequential execution**: Commands execute in FIFO order per session
- **Timeout handling**: Configurable timeouts with heartbeat monitoring
- **Recovery mechanisms**: Automatic retry and circuit breaker patterns
- **Status tracking**: Real-time status updates and progress reporting

### Efficient Command Monitoring

**Bulk Status Polling Pattern (Recommended):**
```json
// 1. Queue multiple commands
nexus_enqueue_async_dump_analyze_command(sessionId, "!analyze -v")
nexus_enqueue_async_dump_analyze_command(sessionId, "kL")
nexus_enqueue_async_dump_analyze_command(sessionId, "!threads")

// 2. Poll ALL commands at once (efficient)
nexus_get_dump_analyze_commands_status(sessionId)
// Returns: Status of all commands with timing and progress

// 3. Get individual results when completed
nexus_read_dump_analyze_command_result(sessionId, "cmd-123")
```

**Benefits of Bulk Polling:**
- **Single API call** instead of multiple individual polls
- **Reduced network overhead** and latency
- **Better performance** for monitoring multiple commands
- **Unified view** of all command statuses in one response
- **Easier to implement** efficient polling loops

**When to Use Individual Polling:**
- Only when you need the **full command output** (not just status)
- When a specific command shows "Completed" status
- For **debugging** specific command issues

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- **Intelligent caching**: LRU eviction with memory pressure monitoring
- **Resource cleanup**: Proper disposal of CDB processes and sessions
- **Memory limits**: Configurable limits with automatic cleanup

### Concurrency
- **Thread safety**: All public methods must be thread-safe
- **Async patterns**: Use `async/await` for I/O operations
- **Cancellation**: Support `CancellationToken` for long-running operations

### Scalability
- **Session limits**: Configurable maximum concurrent sessions
- **Command queuing**: Prevents resource exhaustion
- **Circuit breakers**: Prevents cascade failures

- **No Generic Test Files**: Test files with generic names (e.g., `UtilityTests.cs`, `HelperTests.cs`) are prohibited - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
- **Consolidation Required**: If multiple test files exist for the same production class, they must be consolidated - MANDATORY

#### Test Structure Requirements
- **Test Project Mirroring**: **Test project structure MUST exactly mirror production code structure**. Test directories and namespaces must follow the same organization as production code. ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT.
- **Test Namespace Convention**: **Test namespaces must match production namespaces with `.Tests` suffix**. For example: `mcp_nexus.CommandQueue.Batching` → `mcp_nexus.CommandQueue.Batching.Tests`. NO EXCEPTIONS.
- **Test Directory Alignment**: **Test directories must mirror production directories exactly**. If production has `CommandQueue/Batching/`, tests must have `CommandQueue/Batching/` with `.Tests` namespace. MANDATORY.
- **Test Class Organization**: **Test classes must be organized in the same sub-namespaces as their production counterparts**. NO EXCEPTIONS.

## Extension System Architecture (v1.0.6.65)

### Overview

The extension system allows complex debugging workflows to be implemented as external PowerShell scripts that can make callbacks to the MCP server to execute WinDBG commands. This solves the problem of AI agents having difficulty orchestrating multi-step debugging sequences.

### Core Problem Solved

**Before:** AI agents would fail when trying to execute workflows like:
1. Get stack trace with `kL`
2. Parse output to extract return addresses
3. Run `lsa` on each address to download sources
4. Aggregate results

**After:** These workflows are implemented as extension scripts that handle the orchestration internally while making callbacks to execute individual commands.

### Session Lifecycle Coupling

**Implemented:** Extensions are automatically killed when their session closes.

**Behavior:**
- When `SessionLifecycleManager.CloseSessionAsync` is called:
  1. Queries `ExtensionCommandTracker` for all running extensions in the session
  2. Calls `ExtensionExecutor.KillExtension` for each running extension
  3. Logs a warning: `🔪 Killed extension script command {CommandId} ({ExtensionName}) due to session {SessionId} closure`
  4. Cleans up tracking data with `ExtensionCommandTracker.RemoveSessionCommands`

**Timeout Behavior:**
- Extensions have a configurable timeout (default: 30 minutes, set in `metadata.json`)
- When timeout expires:
  1. Extension process is killed with `process.Kill(entireProcessTree: true)`
  2. Logs a warning: `🔪 Killed extension script '{Extension}' (command {CommandId}) due to timeout after X seconds (timeout: Yms)`
  3. Extension result is marked as failed with `OperationCanceledException`
- To disable timeout, set `"timeout": 0` in `metadata.json`

**Result Persistence:**
- Extension results are stored in the same `SessionCommandResultCache` as standard commands
- Results persist until the session closes (consistent with standard commands)
- Automatic cleanup when session ends
- Same memory management and LRU eviction as standard commands
- Results are stored in both `ExtensionCommandTracker` (for state/progress) and `SessionCommandResultCache` (for persistence)

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. **Extension Scripts Run as Separate Processes (NOT in Command Queue)**

**Critical Architecture Point:**
- Extensions execute as **standalone processes** (PowerShell, etc.)
- They **do NOT** block the command queue
- They **submit commands to the queue** like any other client
- Each callback command goes through normal queue flow

**Why this works:**
```
Extension Process          Command Queue (Serial)
     |                            |
     |-- Callback: Execute "kL" -->|
     |                          [kL executes]
     |<--- Result of "kL" ---------|
     |-- Parse output...
     |-- Callback: Execute "lsa" ->|
     |                          [lsa executes]
     |<--- Result of "lsa" -------|
     |-- Aggregate...
```

**No Deadlock** because:
- Extension is external → doesn't block queue
- Each callback is a normal command in queue
- Commands execute sequentially as designed

#### 2. **Unified Command Tracking**

Extensions get their own `commandId` (prefixed with `ext-`) which allows:
- AI can track extension progress with `nexus_get_dump_analyze_commands_status(sessionId)` (bulk polling)
- AI can get individual results with `nexus_read_dump_analyze_command_result(ext-xxx)`
- Same polling mechanism as regular commands
- Consistent UX for AI agents
- **Efficient monitoring**: Use bulk status polling to monitor extension + regular commands together

#### 3. **Security: Localhost-Only HTTP Callbacks with Token Authentication**

**Callback Mechanism:**
- Extensions use HTTP REST API to callback
- API binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- Each extension gets a unique, short-lived token
- Token is session-scoped and revoked after completion

**Why HTTP over Named Pipes:**
- Simple, standard protocol
- Easy to debug with curl/Postman
- Cross-platform (for future)
- PowerShell has excellent HTTP support

**AI Protection:**
- AI **never sees** callback URLs or tokens
- Tokens validated by server before execution
- If AI tries to call callback endpoint directly → 403 with helpful message

#### 4. **PowerShell-Only (No Python)**

**Decision:** Support only PowerShell scripts initially.

**Reasoning:**
- PowerShell is standard on Windows
- Excellent text parsing capabilities
- Native JSON support
- Good HTTP client (Invoke-RestMethod)
- Users are Windows debugging experts (likely know PowerShell)

**Implementation:** `ExtensionExecutor` validates `scriptType == "powershell"`

#### 5. **Helper Module for Extension Developers**

**File:** `mcp_nexus/extensions/modules/McpNexusExtensions.psm1`

**Purpose:** Abstract callback complexity from extension developers.

**Example:**
```powershell
Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\..\modules\McpNexusExtensions.psm1"

# Simple command execution - complexity hidden
$stack = Invoke-NexusCommand "kL"

# Parse and execute more commands
$addresses = Parse-StackAddresses $stack
foreach ($addr in $addresses) {
    $source = Invoke-NexusCommand "lsa $addr"
    # Process source...
}
```

#### 6. **Extension Discovery: Convention over Configuration**

**Structure:**
```
extensions/
  ├── modules/
  │   └── McpNexusExtensions.psm1    # Shared helper
  ├── stack_with_sources/
  │   ├── metadata.json               # Auto-discovered
  │   └── stack_with_sources.ps1      # Script
  ├── basic_crash_analysis/
  │   ├── metadata.json
  │   └── basic_crash_analysis.ps1
  └── [extension_name]/
      ├── metadata.json
      └── [script].ps1
```

**Discovery:** 
- `ExtensionManager` scans `extensions/` for `metadata.json`
- Validates metadata and script file existence
- Loads all extensions at startup

**Deployment:**
- Extensions auto-copy to `bin/` during build
- Users can drop new extensions and restart server
- No recompilation needed

### Data Flow Example: Stack with Sources

```
1. AI calls: nexus_execute_extension("stack_with_sources")
   ├─> ExtensionCommandTracker: Track "ext-123"
   ├─> ExtensionTokenValidator: Create token
   └─> ExtensionExecutor: Start PowerShell

2. PowerShell script loads helper module
   └─> Has access to: Invoke-NexusCommand function

3. Script executes: Invoke-NexusCommand "kL"
   ├─> HTTP POST to localhost:port/extension-callback/execute
   ├─> Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ├─> Body: { command: "kL", timeoutSeconds: 300 }
   └─> Waits for response

4. ExtensionCallbackController receives request
   ├─> Validates: Token (session-scoped, time-limited)
   ├─> Validates: Request from localhost only
   ├─> Increments: Callback count in tracker
   ├─> Enqueues: Command in session's queue
   └─> Waits: For command completion (blocking for THIS request)

5. Command executes in CDB session (serialized)
   └─> Result returned to controller

6. Controller returns result to script
   └─> Script continues with next step

7. Script completes, returns JSON output
   └─> ExtensionCommandTracker stores result

8. AI polls: nexus_get_dump_analyze_commands_status(sessionId)
   ├─> Returns: Status of ALL commands including "ext-123"
   └─> Shows progress for extension and any other commands

9. AI gets result: nexus_read_dump_analyze_command_result("ext-123")
   └─> Returns: Extension output when status shows "Completed"
```

- `mcp_nexus_tests/Extensions/ExtensionCallbackControllerTests.cs` - 8 tests
- `mcp_nexus_tests/Extensions/ExtensionExecutorTests.cs` - 40 tests

### Configuration

**appsettings.json:**
```json
{
  "McpNexus": {
    "Extensions": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "ExtensionsPath": "extensions",
      "CallbackPort": 0  // 0 = use MCP server port
    }
  }
}
```

### Extension Metadata Format

**metadata.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "extension_name",
  "description": "What this extension does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "scriptType": "powershell",
  "scriptFile": "script.ps1",
  "timeout": 1800000,
  "requires": ["McpNexusExtensions"],
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "paramName",
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Parameter description",
      "required": false,
      "default": "defaultValue"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Creating a New Extension

1. **Create folder:** `extensions/my_extension/`
2. **Create metadata.json** (see format above)
3. **Create PowerShell script:**
```powershell
# Import helper module
Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\..\modules\McpNexusExtensions.psm1" -Force

# Write progress
Write-NexusProgress "Starting analysis..."

# Execute commands
$output1 = Invoke-NexusCommand "!analyze -v"
$output2 = Invoke-NexusCommand "lm"

# Return structured result
@{
    success = $true
    analysis = $output1
    modules = $output2
} | ConvertTo-Json
```

4. **Restart server** - Extension is auto-discovered

### Timeout Behavior

**Regular Commands:** 
- Default: 300 seconds
- Enforced by command queue

**Extensions:**
- No strict timeout (or very long)
- Depends on callback timeouts
- Individual callbacks have normal timeouts
- Overall extension can run as long as needed

### Security Considerations

1. **Token-based authentication** - Short-lived, session-scoped
2. **Localhost-only binding** - Callback API not network-accessible
3. **AI isolation** - AI never sees tokens or callback URLs
4. **Process isolation** - Extensions run in separate processes
5. **Token revocation** - Automatic cleanup after completion

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:** Test each component in isolation
- Mock file system for ExtensionManager
- Mock processes for ExtensionExecutor
- Mock HTTP context for ExtensionCallbackController

**Integration Tests:** Test full workflow (future)
- Real PowerShell execution
- Actual callback communication
- End-to-end extension execution

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ **Don't make extensions blocking commands in the queue**
   - ✅ They are separate processes that submit commands

2. ❌ **Don't expose callback URLs/tokens to AI**
   - ✅ Use MCP tools, let server handle callbacks

3. ❌ **Don't add Python support without discussion**
   - ✅ PowerShell-only by design

4. ❌ **Don't create extensions that bypass session isolation**
   - ✅ All commands go through session's command queue

5. ❌ **Don't add `*.py` files to build output**
   - ✅ Only `*.ps1`, `*.psm1`, `*.json` files

### Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

- **Dynamic timeout:** Extend based on callback activity
- **Progress streaming:** Real-time progress to AI
- **Extension hot-reload:** Discover new extensions without restart
- **Extension dependencies:** Extensions calling other extensions

---

## Async Command Execution (v1.0.7.5)

### Problem

Extension scripts using synchronous `Invoke-NexusCommand` cannot leverage command batching because each command blocks until completion, preventing multiple commands from being queued together.

### Solution

Added async command execution functions that queue commands without blocking, enabling the internal command batching system to improve throughput.

### New PowerShell Functions

- `Start-NexusCommand` - Queue a command, returns command ID immediately
- `Wait-NexusCommand` - Block until queued command completes
- `Get-NexusCommandResult` - Check command status without blocking
- `Start-NexusCommands` - Queue multiple commands at once

### New HTTP Endpoint

- `POST /extension-callback/queue` - Queue command without waiting (enables batching)

### Usage Example

```powershell
# Queue multiple commands (enables batching)
$ids = Start-NexusCommands -Commands @("lm", "!threads", "!peb")

# Wait for all to complete
foreach ($id in $ids) {
    $result = Wait-NexusCommand -CommandId $id
    Process-Result $result
}
```

### Benefits

- Commands queued together can be batched automatically by `BatchCommandProcessor`
- Better throughput for bulk operations
- Backward compatible with existing `Invoke-NexusCommand` (synchronous)

---

## Command Batching System Architecture

### Overview

The command batching system improves throughput by intelligently grouping multiple commands into a single execution batch. This is transparent to AI clients and maintains command dependencies by executing batches sequentially within each session.

### Core Problem Solved

**Before Batching:**
- Each command executed individually
- High overhead from process communication
- Slower throughput for multiple sequential commands
- Timeouts set per command could be conservative

**After Batching:**
- Commands automatically grouped (up to configurable limit)
- Single execution with multiple commands
- Improved overall throughput
- Adaptive timeouts based on batch size

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. **Batching is Internal and Transparent**

**Critical Architecture Point:**
- Batching happens **inside** `IsolatedCommandQueueService`
- AI clients see **no difference** in behavior
- Commands still queued individually
- Results stored and retrieved individually
- No changes needed to MCP tools or AI integration

**Why this works:**
```
AI Client                    IsolatedCommandQueueService
   |                                   |
   |-- Queue: Command A -------------->|
   |-- Queue: Command B -------------->| [Batch: A, B, C]
   |-- Queue: Command C -------------->|     |
   |                                   |     v
   |                                   | Execute Combined
   |                                   |     |
   |<-- Result A ----------------------|     v
   |<-- Result B ----------------------| Parse & Distribute
   |<-- Result C ----------------------|
```

**No Race Conditions** because:
- Batching is session-scoped → isolated per session
- Commands execute sequentially within batch
- Results parsed and stored atomically
- Cache is thread-safe

#### 2. **Configurable Batching Behavior**

Batching is fully configurable via `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "McpNexus": {
    "Batching": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "MaxBatchSize": 5,
      "BatchWaitTimeoutMs": 2000,
      "BatchTimeoutMultiplier": 1.0,
      "MaxBatchTimeoutMinutes": 30,
      "ExcludedCommands": [
        "!analyze", "!dump", "!heap", "!memusage", "!runaway",
        "~*k", "!locks", "!cs", "!gchandles"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Parameters:**
- **Enabled**: Enable/disable batching system-wide
- **MaxBatchSize**: Maximum commands per batch (default: 5)
- **BatchWaitTimeoutMs**: Max wait time to accumulate commands (default: 2000ms)
- **BatchTimeoutMultiplier**: Multiplier for timeout calculation (default: 1.0)
- **MaxBatchTimeoutMinutes**: Cap for batch timeout (default: 30 minutes)
- **ExcludedCommands**: Commands that should never be batched

#### 3. **Smart Command Filtering**

**Exclusion List:**
Commands that should **not** be batched:
- `!analyze` - Complex, long-running analysis
- `!dump`, `!heap`, `!memusage` - Memory-intensive operations
- `!runaway` - Performance profiling
- `~*k`, `!locks`, `!cs` - Thread analysis
- `!gchandles` - Managed heap analysis

**Why exclude these:**
- They are **long-running** and batching adds no value
- They may **change debugger state** significantly
- They produce **large output** that's better processed alone
- Batching them could exceed timeout limits

**Prefix Matching:**
The `BatchCommandFilter` uses prefix matching, so:
- Exclusion `"!analyze"` blocks: `!analyze`, `!analyze -v`, `!analyzev`
- Exclusion `"~*k"` blocks: `~*k`, `~*kv`, `~*kp`

#### 4. **Adaptive Timeout Calculation**

**Formula:**
```csharp
BatchTimeout = Min(
    BaseCommandTimeout * CommandCount * BatchTimeoutMultiplier,
    MaxBatchTimeoutMinutes
)
```

**Example:**
- Base command timeout: 10 minutes (600,000ms)
- Commands in batch: 3
- Multiplier: 1.0
- **Calculated timeout**: 30 minutes (capped at MaxBatchTimeoutMinutes)

**Why this works:**
- Larger batches get more time
- Cap prevents runaway timeouts
- Multiplier allows tuning for specific environments

#### 5. **Batch Parsing with Sentinel Markers**

**Sentinel Markers:**
```csharp
public const string BatchStart = "MCP_NEXUS_BATCH_START";
public const string BatchEnd = "MCP_NEXUS_BATCH_END";
public const string CommandSeparator = "MCP_NEXUS_CMD_SEP";
```

**Batch Command Format:**
```
.echo MCP_NEXUS_BATCH_START; .echo MCP_NEXUS_CMD_SEP_CMD-123_START; <actual command>; .echo MCP_NEXUS_CMD_SEP_CMD-123_END; .echo MCP_NEXUS_CMD_SEP_CMD-456_START; <actual command>; .echo MCP_NEXUS_CMD_SEP_CMD-456_END; .echo MCP_NEXUS_BATCH_END
```

**Why this works:**
- Each command's output is clearly delimited
- Parser can reliably extract individual results
- Unique IDs prevent cross-contamination
- Robust against commands that produce special characters

**Total: 48 batching-specific tests**

### Performance Considerations

#### Memory Management
- **Bounded queues**: Maximum batch size prevents unbounded growth
- **Timeout-based flushing**: Commands don't wait indefinitely
- **Per-session isolation**: Each session has its own batch processor
- **Automatic cleanup**: Batch processor disposed with session

#### Concurrency
- **Thread safety**: All batch operations are thread-safe
- **Background processing**: Batching happens on dedicated background task
- **No blocking**: Queue operations don't block command submission
- **Cancellation support**: Proper cancellation token handling

### Batching Behavior Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Batching
```
Time  | Event
------|----------------------------------------------
0ms   | AI queues: "lm"
10ms  | AI queues: "!threads"
20ms  | AI queues: "!peb"
2000ms| Batch timeout reached
      | → Execute batch: "lm", "!threads", "!peb"
      | → Parse results
      | → Store in cache
```

#### Example 2: Immediate Batch (Max Size Reached)
```
Time  | Event
------|----------------------------------------------
0ms   | AI queues 5 commands (all batchable)
1ms   | MaxBatchSize (5) reached
      | → Execute batch immediately
      | → No wait for timeout
```

#### Example 3: Mixed Batchable/Non-Batchable
```
Time  | Event
------|----------------------------------------------
0ms   | AI queues: "lm" (batchable)
10ms  | AI queues: "!analyze -v" (excluded)
      | → "lm" added to batch queue
      | → "!analyze -v" executed immediately (single)
20ms  | AI queues: "!threads" (batchable)
      | → Added to batch queue with "lm"
2000ms| Batch timeout
      | → Execute batch: "lm", "!threads"
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ **Don't add commands to exclusion list without reason**
   - ✅ Only exclude truly long-running or state-changing commands

2. ❌ **Don't set MaxBatchSize too high**
   - ✅ Keep it reasonable (3-10) to avoid timeout issues

3. ❌ **Don't disable batching to "fix" issues**
   - ✅ Investigate root cause and adjust configuration

4. ❌ **Don't assume batching changes command order**
   - ✅ Commands within a batch execute in order

5. ❌ **Don't forget to update BatchingConfiguration when changing appsettings.json**
   - ✅ Keep model in sync with config file

### Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

- **Dynamic batch sizing**: Adjust based on command execution times
- **Smart command grouping**: Group related commands together
- **Batch statistics**: Track batch efficiency metrics
- **Adaptive exclusion list**: Learn which commands batch poorly

## For Future AI Assistants

When working on this project:
1. **Read AGENTS.md first** - Understand the architecture before making changes - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
2. **Follow the established patterns** - Especially for extensions and batching - MANDATORY
3. **PowerShell-only for extension scripts** - No Python - NO EXCEPTIONS
4. **Add tests for new features** - Maintain test coverage - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
5. **Zero-regression policy** - All existing tests must pass - MANDATORY
6. **Update this document** - If architecture changes significantly - NO EXCEPTIONS

### Extension System Key Principle

**Extensions orchestrate workflows externally, using callbacks for individual commands. - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**

This design prevents deadlocks, maintains session isolation, and gives AI agents a reliable way to execute complex debugging workflows. NO EXCEPTIONS.

### Command Batching Key Principle

**Batching improves throughput internally, while being completely transparent to AI clients. - MANDATORY**

This design maintains command dependencies, prevents race conditions, and provides configurable performance optimization without requiring changes to AI integration. ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT.

## Logging Severity Policy (NO EXCEPTIONS)

The following logging severity levels MUST be used consistently across the entire product. These definitions are binding and there are NO EXCEPTIONS.

- ERROR: Fatal issue from which the product cannot recover.
- WARN: Something unusual happened; the product can handle it autonomously.
- INFO: Normal logs with interesting and helpful information for end users.
- DEBUG: Normal logs with useful technical information for product developers only.
- TRACE: Same as DEBUG but reserved for very high-frequency logs (more than once per second).

Enforcement:
- Choose the lowest severity that accurately conveys the situation per the definitions above.
- Do not use ERROR for recoverable or expected conditions.
- Prefer INFO for user-relevant milestones and state changes; prefer DEBUG/TRACE for internal details.
- TRACE should be disabled by default in production configurations.
