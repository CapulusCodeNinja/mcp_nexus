### 📝 **TASK: Windows Crash Dump Analysis System**

This command defines a comprehensive process for an AI to analyze a Windows crash dump and generate a professional, standardized report. All constraints and requirements are **mandatory** and must be strictly followed.

***

### 🔒 **MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS**

* **Source Code:** Prefer source code loaded from the actual source code server instead of **reconstructing** it. In any case, please leave a note about where the source is coming from.
* **Dump Analysis:** You are supposed to use the **capabilities** of the Nexus MCP server to **analyze** the dump file.
* **MCP connection:** **DO NOT** use other tools like **curl** to establish the **connection**. The server and tools should be **available**.

***

### 🎯 **OBJECTIVE**

Analyze the crash dump file specified by `[filename]` to determine the root cause. The AI must produce a professional, comprehensive report in **Markdown (MD) format**, adhering to enterprise debugging standards. The report must provide a complete analysis and all necessary information for a developer to solve the issue, including a definitive **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**. Prioritize depth of investigation to fully isolate the fault and provide actionable insights. The report must be ready for immediate developer action and be as exhaustive as possible.

***

### 🔧 **REQUIRED ACTIONS & WORKFLOW**

The following steps must be performed sequentially. Ensure all mandatory rules are followed at each stage.

1. **Initialize Analysis:** Open the analyze session for the dump file with the tool from Nexus MCP server `nexus_open_dump_analyze_session`. Feel free to run multiple sessions in parallel if it helps to make the **analysis** faster, the system **resources** allow that and the commands are independent
2. **Source Code Retrieval:**    
    * Enable source verbosity: `.srcnoisy 3`
    * Ensure the folder exists `[workingdir]\source`
    * Set the source server path: `!home "[workingdir]\source"`
    * Enable the source server: `.srcfix+`
    * Execute the extension to resolve sources for the current stack and frames.
    * Use tool: `nexus_enqueue_async_extension_command` with `sessionId` and `extensionName = "stack_with_sources"`.
    * The tool returns a `commandId` (prefixed with `ext-`)
    * **Efficient Monitoring:** Use `nexus_get_dump_analyze_commands_status(sessionId)` to poll ALL commands in the session at once (recommended for better performance)
    * Get individual results via `nexus_read_dump_analyze_command_result` using the same `sessionId` and returned `commandId` when status shows "Completed"
    * When completed successfully the sources for the faulting frames should be available on the filesystem
    * If source is not found for the current frame, try `lsa [ADDRESS]` where `ADDRESS` is the instruction address.
    * Note: Source files (if found) will be in `[workingdir]/source`.
3. **Standard Analysis:**
    * Execute the baseline crash analysis extension.
    * Use tool: `nexus_enqueue_async_extension_command` with `sessionId` and `extensionName = "basic_crash_analysis"`.
    * The tool returns a `commandId` (prefixed with `ext-`).
    * **Efficient Monitoring:** Use `nexus_get_dump_analyze_commands_status(sessionId)` to monitor all commands in the session
    * Get individual results via `nexus_read_dump_analyze_command_result` using the same `sessionId` and returned `commandId` when status shows "Completed"
    * On success, the result contains outputs from core analysis commands and a concise summary to guide next steps.
4. **Comprehensive and in-depth Analysis:**
    * Perform a thorough analysis to pinpoint the **exact root cause**.
    * Gather all helpful information from the dump.
    * For exceptions, collect all necessary data, including the type and the `what()` string.
    * For timeouts, execute WinDbg commands in single, sequential steps.
    * Run extended WinDbg commands to gain a more detailed view of the issue.
    * **Efficient Command Management:** When running multiple WinDbg commands, queue them all first with `nexus_enqueue_async_dump_analyze_command`, then use `nexus_get_dump_analyze_commands_status(sessionId)` to monitor all commands at once for better performance
    * **Consider checking** the `workflows` resource for **helpful** commands for the specific issue.
5. **Analyze the root cause:**
    * **Summarize** the results from the previous steps.
    * Analyze all the current data in-depth to find the root cause of the crash.
    * Make an internet research for common ways to **analyze** the specific type of crashes.
    * Consider to reiterate and go back and forth between this and the previous step. **Run further needed or more advanced analysis commands to get the full picture.**
6. **File Generation & Verification:**
    * Generate all required files and ensure they strictly follow all mandatory rules, usability, and style guidelines.
    * Read all generated files to confirm they meet all criteria before finalizing the task.
7. **CRITICAL EXIT:** You **MUST** immediately exit/terminate after completing the analysis report. Do not wait for additional input.

***

#### 📄 **ISSUE LOG PAGES**

Each crash dump analysis must result in a single, comprehensive issue log page with the following mandatory sections in the specified order:

1. **Table of Contents:** Generate an automatic Table of Contents at the beginning of the document to improve navigation.
2. **Executive Summary:** A concise summary of the issue and its severity.
3. **System Information:** Key details about the system where the crash occurred.
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** A detailed explanation of the precise root cause.
5. **Faulting Thread Stack Trace:** The full stack trace of the thread that caused the crash.
6. **Source Code at Faulting Position:** The source code snippet where the crash occurred.
7. **Source Code Analysis:** An analysis of the code snippet, explaining why it led to the crash.
8. **WinDbg Command Output:** The complete output of all WinDbg commands performed with the command itself.
9. **Recommended Fixes and Actions:** Concrete suggestions for a solution, including C++ code examples.
10. **Conclusion & Recommendations:** A final verdict and actionable recommendations, presented as a findings card.
11. **Citation & Reference list:** In case external references were used, you **HAVE TO** mention and explain for what purpose you used the information. Do not forget to add **full, clickable URLs (e.g., starting with `http://` or `https://`)** to the external resources which you have access so that the reader of the analysis can follow up on them.

***

### 📄 **MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT**

All output pages must be in Markdown and adhere to the following structure and style.

* **CRITICAL:** The output must be a single MD file saved to the directory `[outputdir]` with the name `dump.md`.
* **Create the output directory:** You MUST create the `[outputdir]` directory if it doesn't exist.

***

### 🖥️ **CODE BLOCKS & STYLE**

* **ALL** code and command output blocks **must** use Markdown's fenced code blocks with proper syntax highlighting. Use `cpp` for C++ code, `assembly` for assembly code, and `shell` for WinDbg command output.
* **Line Numbers:** Line numbers **must** be manually added to all code blocks, starting from `1` for each block.
    * The numbers should be formatted as part of the content, allowing the user to copy and paste the code without them.
    * **Example format:**
        ```markdown
        1 line of code
        2 another line of code
        ```
* **Font:** Use a monospace font for all code and command content.
* **Stack Traces:** Each frame in a stack trace **must** be on its own numbered line.
* **Spacing:** **DO NOT** use unnecessary spaces between lines within code blocks.

***

### 🎨 **MARKDOWN PAGE STYLE GUIDE**

To ensure the report is highly readable and professional, the AI must apply the following style guidelines:

* **Headings:** Use proper Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to create a logical hierarchy and structure the content effectively. Use a single `#` for the main title of the document.
* **Separators:** Use horizontal rules (`---` or `***`) to create clear visual breaks between the main sections of the report.
* **Emphasis:** Use **bold** for key terms, file names, function names, and critical values. Use *italics* for less critical emphasis or to highlight observations.
* **Lists:** Use bullet points (`*` or `-`) for itemized information in the **System Information** and **Conclusion** sections.
* **Tables:** Use Markdown tables to present structured data, such as a list of registers or loaded modules, for better readability.
* **Clarity:** Use clear, concise language. Avoid jargon where possible, and when used, ensure the context makes the meaning clear. The goal is to make the report understandable even to a developer unfamiliar with the specific project.
